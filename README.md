# **THRIFTY NYC Website**
The THRIFTY NYC Website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices.  It allows visitors to find out more about free and discounted activities in New York.  The site has been built using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for the Milestone 1 project for Code Institute's diploma in Web Development.

     ![nyc-flag-colours](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/db1196b1-f018-4f89-86c7-5ae12e14e1c8)
     After putting the colours through(https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) I had this result
     ![original colour contrast check](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/e5a210dd-3eaf-45a9-8f2b-4c34a332ba1d)
     I decided I still liked the orange and navy contrast but lightened the orange colour

* ### Typography 
   The two fonts used in the website are Poppins and Lexend Deca.  For the Navbar and heading Poppins has been used with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This is a clear and easy to read font. Lexend Deca is the main font used for the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font if Lexend isn't working properly.  Lexend is a dyslexia friendly font which is also beneficial for short-sighted people.

* ### Imagery
  The hero image has been chosen because it's an eye-catching instantly recognisable icon of New York.  All other pictures are also
  familiar images.  All images were taken myself.

* ### Wireframes

  ![canva-wireframe](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/b34dea91-1f20-46dd-88e5-00ce463f6065)

## Features
  The website a single scrolling page consisting of three sections: Home, Tips and Gallery.

  * ### Navigation bar
    * ### 
      The navigation bar is at the top of the website to navigate to the different sections.

    * ### 
      On larger screens the title is at the left of the navbar and the navigation links are on the right as HOME | TIPS | GALLERY. On smaller screens the title is on the left and a hamburger button on the right. When expanded the section titles have a font awesome icon and are in the middle of the screen.  When a title is clicked the background turns the orange colour of the website background with a green border around it.

  Desktop Navbar ![navbar desktop -fotor-2024021815482](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/0bf9b1cc-0b51-4433-b877-688339c0dd5e)
  Mobile Navbar 

  ![mobile navbar](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/277446c5-7b59-4ab2-9a7a-0cc992dfe13f)

  * ### Home Section
    * ###
      The home section consists of a hero image, an image and introduction text and useful website icons.

    * ###
      The Statue of Libery is used as the hero image.  This is an instantly recognisable monument so users know exactly what the website is about without having to read anything.  The hero text is the same orange colour as the website background. Both are fully responsive.

    * ###
      The top of the home section has an aerial image of New York on the left and two paragraphs of introductory text on the right.  For a better user experience on a mobile device the image is above the text and only one paragraph is visible.  On a medium device
      or larger the image and text sit side by side.

    * ###
      The bottom part of the home section has four Font Awesome icons which are linked to useful websites which open on a new page.  On a mobile device the icons are in a vertical line, a medium device icons are 2x2 and on large devices are positioned in a horizontal line.

  * ### Tips Section
    * ###
      The tips section consists of free tips, discouted tips and a form to submit tips.

    * ###
      Both the free tips and discounted tips column have five tips and buttons to get more information about each one.  On a mobile device these are underneath each other but display side by side on medium devices and bigger.

    * ###
      The form part is for someone who has visited New York is able to submit their own tip.

  
  * ### Gallery
    * ###
      The Gallery section consists of cards showing a photograph and text about some of the most iconic features of the city.

    * ###
      On a mobile device, three cards are displayed vertically: Central Park, Grand Central Station and Times Square.  On medium devices, four cards are displayed 2x2, all the mobile cards and Brooklyn Bridge.  On large devices, six cards are displayed 3x2 with Staten Island Ferry and Outdoor cinema being the two new cards. 

  * ### Footer
    * ###
      The Footer section consists of an email address ( thriftynyc@example.com) and social link icons for Facebook, X, Instagram and Tiktok.

## Accessibility
  I have tried to make the website as accessible to everyone as possible.  The ways in which I've done this are:
  * ###
    Using semantic HTML
  * ###
    Using descriptive alt attributes for images throughout the site.
  * ###
    Using easy to read dyslexia friendly fonts.
  * ###
    Using a relevant yet contrasting colour scheme on the whole page.
  * ###
    Providing clear navigation

## Future Implementations 
  * ### 
    As more tips are sent in they could be categorised into different types of attractions eg museums, outdoor, food etc.  People could also search for free or discounted tips.  Eventually they could be alphabetized too. 
  * ###
    Discounted deals could be made with food locations offering a percentage off if the customer mentions THRIFTY NYC.
  * ###
    Photos could also be submitted to extend the photo gallery.
