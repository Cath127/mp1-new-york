     I decided I still liked the orange and navy contrast but lightened the orange colour

* ### Typography 
   The two fonts used in the website are Poppins and Lexend Deca.  For the Navbar and heading Poppins has been used with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This is a clear and easy to read font. Lexend Deca is the main font used for the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font if Lexend isn't working properly.  Lexend is a dyslexia friendly font which is also beneficial for short-sighted people.

  * ### Home Section
    * ###
      The home section consists of a hero image, an image and introduction text and useful website icons.

    * ###
      The Statue of Libery is used as the hero image.  This is an instantly recognisable monument so users know exactly what the website is about without having to read anything.  The hero text is the same orange colour as the website background. Both are fully responsive.

      The top of the home section has an aerial image of New York on the left and two paragraphs of introductory text on the right.  For a better user experience on a mobile device the image is above the text and only one paragraph is visible.  On a medium device
      or larger the image and text sit side by side.

    * ###
      The bottom part of the home section has four Font Awesome icons which are linked to useful websites which open on a new page.  On a mobile device the icons are in a vertical line, a medium device icons are 2x2 and on large devices are positioned in a horizontal line.
