     After putting the colours through(https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) I had this result
     ![original colour contrast check](https://github.com/Cath127/mp1-new-york/assets/153606011/e5a210dd-3eaf-45a9-8f2b-4c34a332ba1d)
     I decided I still liked the orange and navy contrast but lightened the orange colour

* ### Typography 
   The two fonts used in the website are Poppins and Lexend Deca.  For the Navbar and heading Poppins has been used with Sans Serif as the fallback font. This is a clear and easy to read font. Lexend Deca is the main font used for the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font if Lexend isn't working properly.  Lexend is a dyslexia friendly font which is also beneficial for short-sighted people.
